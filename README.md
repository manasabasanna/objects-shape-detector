# 🟢 Object Shape Detector

The **Object Shape Detector** is a Python-based Computer Vision project that detects and classifies geometric shapes (like circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, etc.) in images using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.  
It helps demonstrate contour detection, image preprocessing, and shape recognition techniques.

## 🧠 **Project Overview**
This project captures or loads an image, processes it using OpenCV, and identifies geometric shapes based on the number of contour edges detected.

It can be used in:
- Educational CV projects  
- Robotics (object classification by shape)  
- Image analysis and automation tasks  

---

## ⚙️ **Features**
- Detects multiple geometric shapes  
- Works on both static images and live camera feed  
- Highlights detected shapes with labels  
- Simple, modular, and easy-to-understand Python code

## 🧰 **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** PyCharm / VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
